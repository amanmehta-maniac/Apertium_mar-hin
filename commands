 amanmehta, so something you could do to significantly improve coverage
9:52 PM is to detect the adjectives
9:52 PM and give them an <adj> tag
9:52 PM and give the adverbs an <adv> tag
9:53 PM and get rid of all <avy>



No adverb is translated properly, shows *<same word> whenever an adverb is translated
words such as नया are tagged as a noun, an adj as well as an adverb. Is it correct? How to prioritise them from one other?

# after translation occurs when the tags of the two monodicts do not match.
*<same word> occurs when their <l> and <r> do not match


line around 334, why is there a repetition of same entry
		<e> 		<p><l>े</l><r><s n="ger"/><s n="nom"/></r></p><par n="__emph"/></e>
		<e> 		<p><l>े</l><r><s n="ger"/><s n="acc"/></r></p><par n="__emph"/></e>

but the tags in <r> differ. What does that mean? DOes that mean that it can be either  n="acc" or n="nom"?

amanmehta: make sure the words are in the bidix
6:46 PM next, add transfer rules
